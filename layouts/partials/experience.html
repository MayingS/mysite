          <B>Machine Learning and Computer Vision Enginner</B><br>
          Performed large scale detection and classification of thousands of stock keeping units, in Tensorflow, achieved mid 90% precision/recall for object detection and increased coverage of stock keeping units by mid double digits percent that reached high precision/recall needed for production service level agreement.<br>
          Investigated and implemented strategy of active learning and image retrieval to improve the efficiency of data labeling.<br>
          Designed and developed modules using Python and OpenCV to automatically process turn-table taken images to increase the volume and diversity of training data, to optimize the fine-grained classification with minor size and appearance variation.<br>
          <B>Machine Learning Intern</B><br>
          Designed and implemented algorithm of image stitching for images taken from multiple camera viewpoints and angles with potentially hostile lighting condition to generate a large panoramic image.<br>
          Founding and core contributor of the real time multiple images object detection service with deep learning models and the stitching algorithm.
